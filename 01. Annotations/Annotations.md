# Annotations

***Annotations are used to specify the data type of a variable, parameter, function return value and other type of values.
It help developers to catch errors early in development by allowing them to specify what type of values can be assigned to a given variable.***

## Example
`let myName: string = "Ashwin";`

***Here we have annotated the variable `myName` with `string` so if we try to input any other type of data to it it would be an error.***
