# Type Aliases
***A type alias is a way to create a new name for an existing type. It allows you to define a custom type that refers to another type and give it a more meaningful or descriptive name.***

## Example
```
type Person = {
    name: string,
    age: number
}
```

***Here `person` is a type we created with the use of type alias.***
