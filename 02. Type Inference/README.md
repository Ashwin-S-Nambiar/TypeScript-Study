# Type Inference
***Type inference is a feature in TypeScript that allows the compiler to automatically determine the type of a variable based on its value.In other words, if you declare a variable without specifying its type, TS will try to infer the type based on its value assigned.***

## Example
`let tech = 'Typescript';`

`console.log(typeof tech); // Output => string`

***Here we have not specified the type of `tech` when setting it's value but TypeScript will infer the type automatically as `string`.***
