# Multidimensional Arrays
***A multi-dimensional array is an array that contains other arrays as its elements. Multi-dimensional arrays can be defined using the same notion as 1-D arrays, but with nested square brackets.***

## Example
```
const matrix: number[][] = [[1,2],[3.4],[5,6]];

console.log(matrix); //Output => [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3.4 ], [ 5, 6 ] ]
```
***We can see that `matrix` is a multidimensional array which is initialized using `number[][]`.***
