# Tuples
***Tuple is a type that represents an array with a fixed number of elements, where each element can have a different type. The order of the types in the tuple definition corresponds to the order of the values in the actual array.***

## Example
```ts
let myTuple: [string, number] = ["hello",42]
console.log(myTuple[0]) // Output => hello
console.log(myTuple[1]) // Output => 42
```
***Here we have a tuple `myTuple` of `[string, number]`.***
